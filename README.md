# Designli technical challenge

## Running the project

To run the project, you will only need to have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

After installing Docker, you can run the project by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will build the Docker image and start the container. The project will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
